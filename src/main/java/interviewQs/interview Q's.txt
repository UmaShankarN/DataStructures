Debugging questions
- How will you debug the scenario where after entering user name & password,
 home page is not displayed & error message is not displayed
 Answers:
 1.) I'll try once after clearing cookies.
 2.) I'll check the network tab, if the request is being sent. if it is sent what is received as response.
 
 Discovery:
 Login is not working after entering username and password.
 
 Preliminary Question's:
 From where the issue is identified. UI, mobile?
 Is this issue happening for a specific user or many user?
 if many users- is this across all region or from specific region?
 if the user is a new user?
 if he is the existing user, when it was worked before?
 version of application if it is mobile app?
 check if there is any recent update or deployment to production?
 If it is mobile or UI specific issue? if it is working in UI and not in mobile, identify the problem.
 what version of mobile OS is available if it is from mobile.
 Browser version of web and kind of web browser used.
 Mobile app- Issue occurred because of more background apps when trying to login.
  
Possible reasons:
Web:
Version of browser
New/Existing user
Prime/Non-Prime user
Region specific
Last worked date time
invalid input
Peak time login

Mobile:
Version of apps
Mobile OS
Background apps
New/Existing user
Prime/Non-Prime user
Region specific
Last worked date time
invalid input
Peak time login

- You are part of MakeMyTrip QA, Indigo flights interested to collaborate with MMT to get booking via MMT. 
From the Indigo side, they have their codebase ready to integrate with MMT.Indigo only has a Production 
environment,MMT has a local, stage, pre-production, and production environment. As a QA what is your 
approach and Design you will do to test the functionality?Testing approach on each environment.

Answer- 1.) I'll understand the requirement from them. How the functionalities, how their requests are 
consumed by their code, how the request and response are stored in the database
in the production environment by connecting with their Devs, QAs and Product team. Ask questions related to the 
requirement, functionalities. Try to mock the response if I am going to send the request from MMT and check 
if the response is expected and deploy it as a service to cloud and test in higher environments
Before that risk of using mock has to be called out as the limitation of proper testing with the actual code
has to be called out from QA perspective.

Brain teaser
- 9 metallic balls in front, all made of same metal and all are same size and same colour, one of the 
balls is defective. Defective ball can weigh lesser or more than other balls given a weighing balance 
find the defective ball. What is the min number of attempts for finding defective what is max number of 
attempts for finding defective ball

1.) Finding Minimum attempt
3 groups - weigh 2 groups - check if it balanced, if it is balanced(chance 1)- one should be in third group
weigh third group each balls one on left and one on right- if balances- third one from third group is defective
so minimum 2 chances

3 attempts
2.) Finding Maximum attempt
3 groups - weigh 2 groups- if it is not balanced, remove one group until it balances to find the not 
balancing one - so worst case in 2 attempt find the group which is defective
in another 2 attempt find the defective from the defective group.
so 4 attempts.

8 attempts- weighing one by one

Test Enumeration

- Test case enumeration for file upload in a portal.
*Verify all supported file formats are uploaded
*Verify drag/drop and upload options are used to upload
*Verify more than one file or bulk upload can be done
*Verify the file size with allowed size limit can be uploaded
 more than allowed size limit cannot be uploaded
*Verify if the upload progress is shown when uploading
*Verify the file uploaded before is allowed to upload again
*Verify the uploaded file information is shown after successful upload
*Verify uploaded file can be removed and uploaded again
*Verify upload can be cancelled while the upload operation is in progress
*Verify file that contains sensitive information can be uploaded 
	if there is any option of scanning while uploading the file
*Verify similarity checks are done when the file is uploaded
*Verify uploaded file can be downloaded and check if the file is not corrupted after uploaded
*Verify no error message when same file name with different file format and same size is uploaded
*Verify password protected file can be uploaded.
*Verify the password protected files security is not removed after uploaded. verify by downloading

*Verify similarity checks are not done when the file is uploaded with password
*Verify error message when the unsupported file formats are tried to uploaded
*Verify error message/file replaced when same file name, same file format with same size is uploaded
*Verify the file names(Upto the limit can be shown if more files are uploaded) are displayed in the UI
*Verify error when more than allowed bulk limit upload is uploaded at the same time.

UI:
*Verify file upload from browser, mobile and other devices like tablet
*Verify file can be downloaded.

Security:
* Verify during the time of upload no sensitive information is exposed even if the file is 
password protected


API:
*Verify file upload can be done using API call(Multipart in restAssured)
*Verify bulk upload of files can be done. 
*Verify batch upload request
*Verify different error messages and successful response
*Verify with invalid headers

Performance:
*Verify multiple user uploads file at the same time(Examinations)
*Verify multiple user uploads same file at the same time
*Verify multiple user uploads large file size at the same time(50 users/1000 users response time 
and compare it with single user)

Compatibility:
*Verify new file format is not supported in older version/build
*Verify file upload scenarios in different browsers and different versions of browser

Usability:
Verify the upload button is recognisable and highlighted from other elements in the page
Verify the error messages are meaningful
Verify the file names are shown as the name of the file uploaded
Verify the failure is called out after the upload time limit is exceeded

Edge cases:
*Network problem - Resume upload
*Network change - Resume upload
*Browser automatic update - Resume upload
*Browser close and open- No information on upload
*Total limit exceeds when the last file is uploaded- Only last shouldn't upload remaining files should
get uploaded

- You have three modules(timer, manual, wi-fi) one is Wi-Fi enabled AC with connected to Router and weÂ can control 
the AC via web applications and mobile applications. What are the types of testing you do?

Brain teaser
- You have two buckets one with capacity of 5 litres and the other with a capacity of 3 litres. 
You have to measure 4 litres using the two buckets.How will you do it??
*Take 3L bucket, fill it with water and pour it in 5L once- Now 5L bucket has 3L of water
*Do one more time and the 5L will be filled and 3L bucket will have 1L of water remaining
*Empty the 5L bucket, pour the 1L water in 5L bucket
*Fill the 3L bucket and pour it in 5L bucket. Now the 5L bucket will have 4L in it.
