Debugging questions
- How will you debug the scenario where after entering user name & password,
 home page is not displayed & error message is not displayed
 Answers:
 1.) I'll try once after clearing cookies.
 2.) I'll check the network tab, if the request is being sent. if it is sent what is received as response.
 
 Discovery:
 Login is not working after entering username and password.
 
 Preliminary Question's:
 From where the issue is identified. UI, mobile?
 Is this issue happening for a specific user or many user?
 if many users- is this across all region or from specific region?
 if the user is a new user?
 if he is the existing user, when it was worked before?
 version of application if it is mobile app?
 check if there is any recent update or deployment to production?
 If it is mobile or UI specific issue? if it is working in UI and not in mobile, identify the problem.
 what version of mobile OS is available if it is from mobile.
 Browser version of web and kind of web browser used.
 Mobile app- Issue occurred because of more background apps when trying to login.
  
Possible reasons:
Web:
Version of browser
New/Existing user
Prime/Non-Prime user
Region specific
Last worked date time
invalid input
Peak time login

Mobile:
Version of apps
Mobile OS
Background apps
New/Existing user
Prime/Non-Prime user
Region specific
Last worked date time
invalid input
Peak time login

- You are part of MakeMyTrip QA, Indigo flights interested to collaborate with MMT to get booking via MMT. 
From the Indigo side, they have their codebase ready to integrate with MMT.Indigo only has a Production 
environment,MMT has a local, stage, pre-production, and production environment. As a QA what is your 
approach and Design you will do to test the functionality?Testing approach on each environment.

Answer- 1.) I'll understand the requirement from them. How the functionalities, how their requests are 
consumed by their code, how the request and response are stored in the database
in the production environment by connecting with their Devs, QAs and Product team. Ask questions related to the 
requirement, functionalities. Try to mock the response if I am going to send the request from MMT and check 
if the response is expected and deploy it as a service to cloud and test in higher environments
Before that risk of using mock has to be called out as the limitation of proper testing with the actual code
has to be called out from QA perspective.

Brain teaser
- 9 metallic balls in front, all made of same metal and all are same size and same colour, one of the 
balls is defective. Defective ball can weigh lesser or more than other balls given a weighing balance 
find the defective ball. What is the min number of attempts for finding defective what is max number of 
attempts for finding defective ball

1.) Finding Minimum attempt
3 groups - weigh 2 groups - check if it balanced, if it is balanced(chance 1)- one should be in third group
weigh third group each balls one on left and one on right- if balances- third one from third group is defective
so minimum 2 chances

3 attempts
2.) Finding Maximum attempt
3 groups - weigh 2 groups- if it is not balanced, remove one group until it balances to find the not 
balancing one - so worst case in 2 attempt find the group which is defective
in another 2 attempt find the defective from the defective group.
so 4 attempts.

8 attempts- weighing one by one

*Verify batch upload request
*Verify different error messages and successful response
*Verify with invalid headers

Performance:
*Verify multiple user uploads file at the same time(Examinations)

and compare it with single user)

Compatibility:
*Verify new file format is not supported in older version/build
*Verify file upload scenarios in different browsers and different versions of browser

Usability:
Verify the upload button is recognisable and highlighted from other elements in the page

Test enumeration 
Consider there are three services cart, reservation and inventory. Functionality of these services are 
as follows. Write test enumeration to test the cart functionality
Cart- to add the items before buying 
Reservation - Store the added items from cart, but it reserves the item only for 10 minutes, 
after that it evicts data. Inventory- a catalog service which has all the item informations

Inventory page: Cart Icon
*Verify the items selected from the catalog are added to the cart. Cart icon from inventory page 
should display the quantity added
*Verify sum quantity should be displayed on Cart icon when same item with more than 
one quantity is added from inventory page
*Verify multiple items selected from the catalog are added to the cart. Cart icon from inventory page
should display the sum quantity of all items added
*Verify quantity displayed over the cart icon gets reset after 10 minutes of adding item to the cart
*Verify multiple items added in a different time within 10 minutes are removed from cart after 10 minutes
of the respective item added to cart. Not all items should be removed by considering the first added item
*Verify an item is removed from cart after 10 minutes of increasing the quantity(last activity)
 from the inventory page
*Verify cart quantity is displayed dynamically when the user increases or decreases the quantity
*Verify out of stock items don't have an option to add to cart in inventory page
*Verify an item removed by the user can be added again to the cart from inventory page
*Verify age restricted items cannot be added by the guest user or by certain age category users

adding items to the cart
*Verify items can be added to wishlist and can be added to cart from wishlist
*Verify user can add the max number of items that a user can purchase and the respective 
quantity is displayed


Inventory page: View item information by clicking on Cart icon/Cart page
*Verify the item information(description, quantity, price, currency type) shown on mouse hover or 
clicked over the cart icon and the same should match the actual
*Verify information of sum price and sum quantity, individual price, individual quantity when multiple 
items are added or when same item with multiple quantity are added and available in the Cart
*Verify items can be modified(Increase or decrease quantity, remove item) from the cart information
*Verify items added from wishlist can be viewed under cart icon

user clicks the Add to Cart and moves to cart page
*Verify error when age restricted items are added by certain age category users.
*Verify error when a user adds a single item if the quantity exceeds the allowed limit.

Performance:
*Verify multiple user adds item at the same time(Festive Sale period or end of deal time)
*Verify multiple user is able to add same item with allowed quantities per user at the same time

Compatibility:
*Verify the above scenarios in different browsers and different versions of browser.

Usability:
*Verify the Add to cart button is recognisable from other elements in the inventory selection page
